		   			<h3>Ask the Question</h3>
		   			<p>From the time we learn to talk we start asking questions. many parents talk about the times in their child's lives where the only thing they asked was "why".  As we grow older we start to ask tougher questions and responses from our inquisitiveness becomes impatience, indifference, or even callousness.  And at this time asking questions becomes embarrasing and can cause anxiety or fear due to response behaviors.  However in a learning environment it is still crucial to ask the question.  Figuring it out on your own is not very effective especially when an answer to one question can put you back on track.</p><br /><p>Remember if you don't know ask. Utilize the teachers that you have and ask them to explain the information to you in a manner that you can understand.  That's what they are paid to do.  They don't know you need help until they test your knowledge. Remember your education is for YOU to succeed. If you don't understand something only you can tell the instructor. So Just ask.</p>
