Highschool is the first time where you will actually need to develop some study skills to get very good grades. here are a few things that are important to remember.  The classroom syllabus is your roadmap to success. If your teachers use rubrics make sure you have a copy.  If you study everything in the rubric you will pass the class.  If you don't know ask, ask, ask. Lastly every school has some form of school access online. If you have forgotten an assignment, need to ask the teacher a question, or need to look at your grades you can probably find it online. </p>

                        <h3>Studying Math</h3>
                        <p>All students learn math differently, but once you understand a concept it's all the same. repetition... repetition... repetition...  The key to learning math is understanding the concept, then solve problems with that concept in as many ways possible.  Make sure that you manipulate the problem in all of its forms and practice solving for all values, not just the values that are given as examples.  Most of the "hard" problem you see on a test use a typical math problem manipulated in a format that is not typically seen.</p>
